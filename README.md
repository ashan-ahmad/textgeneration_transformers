# Transformers for Text Generation

This project demonstrates the implementation of Transformer models for text generation using TensorFlow and Keras. The notebook walks through the entire process, from loading and preprocessing the dataset to building, training, and evaluating a Transformer-based text generation model.

## Features

- **Dataset Loading**: Load and preview the Shakespeare dataset for text generation tasks.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenize and vectorize the text data using TensorFlow's `TextVectorization` layer.
- **Sequence Generation**: Create input and target sequences for training the Transformer model.
- **Transformer Model**: Build a custom Transformer model with multi-head attention, positional encoding, and feed-forward layers.
- **Training**: Train the model with early stopping and visualize the training loss.
- **Text Generation**: Generate text sequences using the trained model with temperature control.
- **Experimentation**: Experiment with different sequence lengths, learning rate schedulers, and generate longer text sequences.

## Project Structure

- **Notebook**: The entire implementation is contained in the Jupyter Notebook file `Transformers_for_Text_Generation.ipynb`.
- **Code Cells**: Python code cells for model implementation, training, and evaluation.
- **Markdown Cells**: Detailed explanations and documentation for each step of the process.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following libraries:

- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
```

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Transformers_for_Text_Generation.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE.
3. Run the cells sequentially to execute the code and follow the explanations.

## Key Highlights

- **Custom Transformer Implementation**: The project includes a custom implementation of Transformer blocks and positional encoding.
- **Text Generation**: Generate creative text sequences based on a given input string.
- **Experimentation**: Modify hyperparameters, sequence lengths, and learning rates to observe their effects on model performance.

## Example Output

Here is an example of text generated by the model:

```
Input: "To be, or not to be"
Generated Text: "To be, or not to be that is the question whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows..."
```
